number validation

remove disable if form error

add edit into every view page

short

notification - localization
 
manually add ng-controller='SearchCtrl'

back should back to last action - 

priority - choose which one - 

throw exception at method even it is runtime to help developer to know there is potentially exception

never ever get null pointer exception

argument is array of object. not the list or hash map - arlina

AOP - better implement interface for all if not will have error. all service class 

standard terminology for onhold, recall

why reserve status different with on hold?

should used object instead of String?

daily loan.

is it daily loan or hourly loan based on who + what?

validation constraint for eligibility. example. daily loan, then ploan must not null. hourly loan, then what mustnot null?

branch or location? eligibility - branch

same spring context

naming convention. checkoutRequest, checkoutResponse, action. Please no ctdocm, ctmatm or anything in rest api except for jpa

javascript, validation, service (LSN can help please).

CKY - what is the problem to name method?

different exception object to handle different exception for reserve, renew and so on. unless generic message format...

system error vs business logic error
//TODO - How this thing happen? It supposed to be system error instead of business logic error
validateReturnedDateTimeIsBeforeBorrowedDateTime(ctdocm, returnedDate);

display template until content loaded

key localization 

button. patron - spring-data-jpa (at url)

*should tell what you try to test before show it.

transaction log ui.

due date - no data

reservation & released for circulation

what kind of demo that we want to do?
